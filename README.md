# Big-Ideas-Final-Project

## Overview

This is our final project for the University of Pittsburgh's CMPINF 0010

## Our Task

We were tasked to make a data-driven argument for the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh using
data from the Western PA Regional Data Center.

## Data

We have chosen to base which neighborhood in Pittsburgh was the best in terms
of how "bike friendly" they are, as Pittsburgh claims to be a bike friendly area.
